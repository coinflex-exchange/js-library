## CoinFLEX's JavaScript client library

CoinFLEX's application programming interface (API) provides our clients programmatic access to control aspects of their accounts and to place orders on the CoinFLEX trading platform. The JavaScript client library exposes the CoinFLEX API to your JavaScript application.

### Invocation model

Each API method accepts a callback function object that will be invoked when the result of the method is available. The callback function receives the reply object exactly as received from the server, so it should check the `error_code` field in the message and act accordingly.

### Example

Please take a look at the CoinFLEX trade page, which has been implemented using this JavaScript client library.


## API

For an explanation of our API methods and what they return, please see our [API specification](https://github.com/coinflex-exchange/API).

### Numbers and scale

All quantities and prices are transmitted and received as integers with implicit scale factors. For scale information, please see [SCALE.md](https://github.com/coinflex-exchange/API/blob/master/SCALE.md).


## Requirements

Use of this library requires a JavaScript engine that supports the [WebSocket protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455).
If your application is a web application, please see this [list of supporting web browsers](http://caniuse.com/websockets).
